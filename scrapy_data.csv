Julian G.,"CA, CA",Best ramen i've ever had! Was almost an hour wait but definitely worth it10/10 Food 10/10 service and 10/10 pricing
Ellie W.,"Danville, CA","Insanely good food, I got the medium spice of the ramen on the special menu and it tasted SO good. One of the best meals I've ever had in San Francisco. We also got the pork buns, oh my god. So incredibly tasty. Very quick service too. And the waiting list to get a seat was much shorter than expected, they got us a table in 10 minutes. Will definitely be going back."
Ma'Shaya P.,"San Francisco, CA","I am usually very picky about going to Ramen places, I prefer to make them myself but this restaurant is absolutely incredible. My Nanna and I went and the food was amazing, freshly hot, not to spicy either. My mother being part of that culture, never finding a Ramen place she liked, truly enjoyed it. The workers there are really nice and professional, we had no problems. This is am amazing place."
Audrey K.,"San Francisco, CA","Definitely my go-to ramen spot in Japan town. I usually get the Tonkotsu DX ultra spicy. The corn, pork belly and chashu are amazing! 10/10"
Ricky K.,"San Francisco, CA","It's time to finally update my review for Marufuku. It's been a good minute since I reviewed this place so now, I can finally give another review about it. I'm so glad I got to come back. When I came, I went inside right when they opened so I actually didn't have to wait in line at all which was very nice. I remember pre-pandemic, you would need to wait hours to even get a seat in this place. Located in the West Wing of Japantown, Marufuku does really well in executing a solid bowl of ramen and I really love the flavors and care that they incorporated into their broths. I love the modern interior as it's very Japanese inspired and it makes you feel like you're in a restaurant in Japan."
Angela K.,"San Francisco, CA",One of my favorite ramen places in the city! The noodles are perfect texture and soup base is always on point. The egg was perfectly soft boiled and the tofu was nicely grilled and flavored.
Nette T.,"San Francisco, CA",I haven't been to Marufuku in a minute so it was good to be back again and update my review. This time I took SO. He normally hates waiting but saw Club Mari next door (that's for another review). I put in my name on the yelp waitlist and instead of being seated in 55 minutes as it stated we were seated in 30. 
Tri D.,"Houston, TX","This is a solid spot for a bowl of ramen. The wait time can be a bit long (30 mins to an hour & 15 mins) but they have an iPad in the front entrance where you can sign up on their waiting list. Since Marufuku is inside the mall, you can wander around and check out some spots while you're killing time. I'll mention that parking isn't the best but you can park around the corner & pay the meter or your other option is the garage parking. "
Cindy B.,"Lompoc, CA","Saw really good reviews on Yelp, so we decided to give Marufuku Ramen a try. This restaurant is located in a shopping mall in Japantown. The restaurant looked modern and nice. The dining area was a bit small and tight; the dining tables were really closed to one another. My family and I came on a Monday around 1-2pm, and they were really busy. We put our name on the waitlist (approx. 45-75 min. for our party of 6), and went around shopping to kill time. They texted us 30 minutes later. Yay, shorter than what we were told! Hehe. "
Fernando F.,"San Francisco, CA",I GET THE HYPE. PERIOD. This rating on Yelp with this high of a rating leads anyone to be skeptical. What are you selling that is THIS GOOD?
Mariana C.,"Point Loma, San Diego, CA","Good service and amazing food! They have a wait list but not too crazy I had to wait just 30min to get in. Staffs are friendly and so polity. To start I we ordered the fried shishito pepper really interested and my entre was the vegetarian ramen. Broth was on point (mild), perfect egg and delicious noodles, make your stomach calm and happy. Delicious experience!"
Vanessa C.,"Rohnert Park, CA","WOW! This has been the best ramen I have ever had in my life. While there is a pretty long wait, there's a lot to do that the wait is not even that bad. We got seated pretty quickly after we received a text that we were off the waitlist. The staff was super nice. We ordered two bowls of tonkotsu and some gyozas (7 pieces). Our food came out super quick!! The broth of the ramen was super rich and my tummy felt so happy after our meal. Definitely recommend coming here if you have the chance"
Sandy A.,"San Jose, CA","Don't be scared away by the long wait. Put yourself in their yelp waitlist and it goes pretty quickly. Service here is excellent, always communicating clearly, checking on customers, very nice. "
Sharon S.,"Philadelphia, PA","We did a SF food adventure and we have to say - Marafuku Ramen is the best ramen we've ever had in the west coast, hands down! Broth is delicious, packed with flavor, and I still haven't found ramen even in the east coast that can top their flavor! Cha shu was the right amount of fatty and was well seasoned. I have nothing bad to say about this place, other than the long wait time. Wait time can be quite long during the weekends, so try to get here early!"
Alexandra L.,"Sacramento, CA",Why 5? 
Jennifer L.,"San Francisco, CA","Marufuku doesn't need an introduction. If you have ever visited this restaurant in person, I'm sure you have seen the line outside... especially on weekends. "
Kysa T.,"San Diego, CA",Came here on a weekday for dinner with a party of 7. We put our name down and the wait was around 45min. We ended up walking around the mall so it wasn't too bad. 
Shannon W.,"San Francisco, CA","I got the chicken paitan deluxe (15 servings per day) to satisfy your and my curiosity over this dish. It is excellent for a hungry person because it's the normal chicken ramen plus the soy sauce braised chicken leg. I prefer my egg softer and more colored. It sounds minuscule, but mirin eggs are the main attraction to having ramen for me, so felt had to comment on it."
Veronica D.,"American Canyon, CA","So, I've been buggin' my husband to take me to SF because I have been craving for Ramen. He YELPED places and found this restaurant. "
Christopher K.,"Sacramento, CA",that.  was.  UH-MAZING!
Heying D.,"Mountain View, CA","This is such an amazing place! It is super cute, comfortable and the ambiance is very nice. It usually has a long line, so better get a reservation."
Patrycja M.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",Place was pretty busy on a Sunday afternoon but the service was very fast and nice! I loved my vegetable ramen. My husband had Hakata Tonkotsu ramen and he also liked it. He said the chicken could be more flavorful. But we definitely recommend this place and would come back. Thank you for having us!
Martin S.,"San Francisco, CA",Plan on waiting to get in -- this place fills up fast. But it's worth it. 
Elizabeth L.,"East Bay, CA","Marufuku Ramen is located upstairs in the Japan Center Malls in Japantown. The line is always long whenever I pass by, not sure if it is because it is a small location or it is just that popular. One day, I decided to try it and ended up waiting over a hour and half to be seated."
Nina W.,"San Jose, CA",Marufuku is still one of my favorite ramen places in SF/Japantown area! They are great for Chicken Paitan ramen which is not as common. 
Anthony D.,"San Jose, CA","One of my favorite restaurants ever and my favorite ramen restaurant, Marufuku specializes in Hakata-style ramen which is characterized by their rich  broth bases. If you love the richness of tonkotsu style broths then Marufuku is a must try."
Celina A.,"San Francisco, CA","Visual Hacker that always gives a perfect job I needed a Hacker who can help me to recover my investment plans, When they denied me the withdrawal of my investment, I saw a testimony about a Great Visual Hacker called GHOST CHAMPION HACKER so I contact him on GHOSTCHAMPIONWizard (at) Gmail dot com. He asks for the necessary information and I send it to him within a maximum of 48hours he was able to give me all the breakdown of my funds and he recovered my funds successfully were able to purchase my dream house and I want everyone to contact him "
Christina R.,"Bakersfield, CA",OMG this place was well worth the wait. Wait time and wait list was about 1-2.5 hours. They use the Yelp waitlist iPad outside the restaurant. I was smart enough to go there first to get on the list before we started our shopping through the mall. We did all of our shopping g in time for dinner so that worked out perfectly. 
Harper A.,"San Bruno, CA",I looovveee their spicy tonkatsu ramen!! My go to bowl of ramen. Usually love to add on bamboo shoots and an egg. This bowl of ramen is definitely filling and super flavorful. My boyfriend usually gets the chicken ramen and he loves it too. Recommend if you're looking for a solid bowl of ramen in the city.
Nora C.,"San Francisco, CA",Marufuku Ramen Ratings: 4.5/5
Cassidy F.,"Los Angeles, CA",This is probably one of the most popular ramen places nearby so we opted to try it! It was supposedly a 2 hour wait on a Wednesday night. The wait ended up being an hour. 
Irene L.,"South San Francisco, CA",Absolutely delicious! This is the ramen standard that is really hard to not compare to after each ramen I have. I've been to Marafuku before at a different location awhile back and recall it being so so good. It's always great when the food is just as good if not better than the previous time. I got the tonkatsu again and the broth was just mind blowing. I tried a little bit of my friend's chicken ramen and was also just beyond wowed. This place will always have a special place in my heart! We also shared the gyoza and found it a nice appetizer to have on the side. I got the chicken karaage to go and absolutely loved it too. We will definitely be back.
Dylan W.,"Cerritos, CA",RATING: 4.6
Anita T.,"Union City, CA","My family & I went to Japantown for lunch and decided to give this place a try. Once the doors opened a waitlist had already formed. Since we were early we didn't have to wait too long 15-20 mins. However, after 15 mins waiting I notice the waitlist extending over 55-85 mins wait. Recommend to go there early folks!"
Patrick P.,"Arlington, VA","Tucked inside Japantown's Japan Center, Marufuku is a fantastic ramen experience with great soup and great service."
David Z.,"Santa Clara, CA",I'm a ramen expert and Marufuku ramen is one of the best I have ever tried.
Hannah L.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",Wow!! I usually compare ramen in the USA to Ichiran in Japan because that was the last time I was fully satisfied with a ramen meal (biased bc I'm not the biggest fan of ramen). But this definitely comes close!! 
Anita S.,"Sacramento, CA",The little shopping center is so cute especially walking around while you wait . The wait was not bad but it was packed ** 
Paul K.,"San Diego, CA","Marufuku ramen is very impressive and I would highly recommend giving it a try. It compares in quality to some of the top ramen I have had in Japan itself, and there are not many places in the states that I can say that about. "
Thuy K.,"Reno, NV",I stopped here for lunch this weekend and was pleasantly surprised to be seated right away as there is usually quite a wait to get in. The restaurant is located in Japantown and parking was easy in the conveniently located garage. The space is quite small but the ambiance was warm and cozy.
Karyn E.,"American Canyon, CA","Wow! Excellent ramen! Everything was very flavorful and delicious. The noodles had just the right amount of chewiness. We ordered the Appetizer Geso Fry, the Hakata Tonkotsu, Chicken Paitan and the Seasonal Spicy TanTan Men. No wonder there is a lone every time we come. Fortunately we visited on a Thursday @ 4pm and there was no line. They do require proof of vaccination and ID to match. Not good for large groups. Children and families ok. Parking is off street and/or in the mall garage. To my knowledge they do not validate for discount. Restaurant is located upstairs inside Japantown Mall West. "
Sneha P.,"San Francisco, CA","I visited Marufuku Ramen for the first time this past Sunday. My friend and I put our name down on the waitlist in person, which is the only waitlist option. And we explored the stores in Japan town for maybe 15-20 minutes before we received a notification that our table was ready. My friend and I both got the Hakatha Tonkatsu DX. The broth was very yummy and there was plenty of meat veggies and the boiled egg was the cherry on top. Don't leg the small looking bowl deceive you. There is plenty of food in the bowl. Overall loved our food and service. I just wish the ""spicy"" ramen was spicier. I still highly recommend it though."
Simon C.,"San Francisco, CA","Incredible ramen, great price, comforting setting. "
George H.,"Pasadena, CA","This might be the best ramen spot in SF. The Hakata Tonkotsu Dx was incredible. With the rich broth, tender and juicy pork, and perfectly cooked noodles, it was one of the best bowls of ramen I have ever had. I would recommend starting with the Chicken Karaage, it was perfectly breaded and fried."
Xin S.,"San Francisco, CA",Recently went back to this classic ramen joint in Japantown as indoors dining became safer with vaccination requirements. Martufuku doesn't disappoint. The line was very well managed and I was sit down within minutes. The staff was efficient and friendly.
Austin H.,"Berkeley, CA","Stopped by today with some friends and had the Chicken Paitan DX (~$18.50). Immediately when I tasted the broth, I knew that THIS was it. The layer of flavors coupled with freshly made ramen made every single moment all worth it. Furthermore, the additional chicken leg piece that came on the side was immaculate. Despite being on a sizzling plate, the meat was still very moist and went well with the sauce they added on top. I will for sure be coming back here time and time again!"
Kevin L.,"Fullerton, CA",I had visited this shop with my friend and we ended up getting the chicken braised meat with ramen.
Nick A.,"San Francisco, CA","Undoubtedly, when it comes to ramen spots in SF, Marufuku Ramen is definitely a top notch choice. Is it the best? That's hard to decide, but you'd hardly be disappointing by dining here. They're known for their Chicken Paitan Broth whereas a lot of other ramen restaurants are more recognized for their pork-based broth. Mauruku Ramen does offer an equally tasty pork-based broth ramen on their menu though.  The chicken paitan is the one I most frequently have when coming here, but they do offer seasonal specials, such as the Spicy Tantan Men that they're having now. I most recently tried this spicy variation and it definitely has a medium-spicy kick to it that can leave a burn on you throat if you're not careful. The chicken paitan DX is the only one I haven't tried since it's limited to the first 15 orders of the day, but if you get here early, you may be lucky enough to experience it. "
Tiffany C.,"San Francisco, CA","Lives up to the hype. Came at 6pm on a Tuesday and only waited for 20 min (it's nice to walk around the mall!) the food was also absurdly fast, we were in and out within 30 minutes! "
Thu N.,"San Francisco, CA",I totally see what all the hype is about. Definitely join the Yelp waitlist ahead of time -- there was about a 40 minute wait during lunch hours for us on a Sunday!
Krissy M.,"San Francisco, CA",So good! Had the vegetable ramen with tofu chashu and was shocked at how delicious it was!
Hannah A.,"San Francisco, CA","Marufuku was amazing! We arrived around 10:40am for 11am opening time on a Friday. There was a line of about 25 people in front of us, but we were able to be seated immediately after opening. I tried the veggie ramen and it was the best I've had. I tend to notice that a lot of veggie ramens are rather bland, but that was not the case for Marufuku's! Theirs had phenomenal flavor and a ton of different types of vegetables in the broth. There was a slight kick to it and the noodles were perfectly cooked. I would highly recommend Marufuku's to any veggie ramen eater! "
Sanjali P.,"San Francisco, CA","Really great ramen. The wait isn't too bad - if the waitlist says 60 minutes, you'll get seated in 30-45 min. "
Tzarina W.,"Chandler, AZ",Covid days omicron 
Jen W.,"San Francisco, CA","I've been wanting to try this place as I've heard it's the best ramen in SF. I had the Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen w/Corn, which was great as the broth was very rich and flavorful and I also liked the thin noodles. We also tried the Menteiko Rice Bowl w/spicy seasoned cod roe, Takoyaki (Octopus Balls), Marukubu Bites (Japanese Steamed Buns filled with homemade pork chashu), and Marufuku Salad. "
Nilay C.,"Davis, CA","Really good quality ramen, the broth was deep and had a complexity of flavor. The staff is really friendly and watchful, they handle a busy night really well."
Jack R.,"San Francisco, CA",I am SO Disappointed in this place. 
Vanessa L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY","Hands down the best ramen I've ever had. Marufuku has a unique hakata broth that I haven't tasted in other ramen joints before. It's simple but packs a punch from the spice. I got the deluxe hakata ramen which came with soft jammy yolk egg, pork belly, chasu slices, ginger, mushroom, corn and scallion. "
Vanessa P.,"Mililani, HI","It seems like there's usually a wait for Marufuku Ramen, but since it's located in the middle of Japan Center, there's plenty of stores to walk through to keep yourself busy while you wait. Once your party is ready to be seated, they give you a call to let you know they're ready."
Melissa J.,"San Jose, CA","This is more of a 3.5/5, but the quick & friendly service bumped it to a 4/5. "
Nancy P.,"San Leandro, CA","Really good ramen. The wait isn't too bad, you can put your name on a Yelp waitlist and explore the shopping mall. We were seated after ~40 mins. "
Anthony P.,"Elmhurst, NY",The popular SF ramen spot lives up to its name! So good that they've opened up a location in NYC too
Prasiddha H.,"San Jose, CA",My friend I was with had been wanting to try marufuku for a long time so decided fo finally give it a try. I have tried the Oakland location (which was okay) so thought why not give this a shot. This place is located in Japan town in a mall area and when we got there there was about a 1-2 hour wait so we ended up getting an order of the tonkatsu ramen. We picked it up around 10 minutes later and ate it on tables outside. 
Bryan K.,"Portland, OR","Marufuku now holds the title of the best ramen I've ever had. It used to be Tam Popo in Tempe, AZ but there is a new champ in town. What a delicious bowl of noodles. The flavor is great and I love how their pork is on the thinner cut side. I hate when ramen places cut their pork so thick. The wait here wasn't too bad. They use Yelp for their wait list and it went much faster than anticipated. I try to stay away from SF as it is on the bottom of cities to visit but when ever I do drive through, this is on the top of the list of places to eat. A hint I will make for some people is to maybe ask for the egg to be cooked longer. It was a little too runny for my preference but that is totally up to you!"
Blanche M.,"Elk Grove, CA","This place is always busy, and we were finally in the mood to try some ramen. So yay! We decided to try this place. "
Scott N.,"Cincinnati, OH",There's a reason this place is so popular!
Laura C.,"Miami, FL","I'm going to try and leave this review small and to the point, which is also how I'd describe Marufuku Ramen. Tiny restaurant, small menu."
Emily H.,"Chicago, IL","we got the hakata tonkotsu, the broth is very rich, and the chashu pork is great!"
Mikaela S.,"Monrovia, CA","what else can you say other than - this place is well worth the hype! I went around 3:30PM on a Sunday afternoon, trying to choose an off time to avoid the wait, but still ended up waiting 40 mins or so. There is lots to do in this plaza so the wait can go by quickly if you explore. "
Susana I.,"Pittsburg, CA",I've been wanting to try out this place for the longest time so I decided to order it for lunch. Online ordering is SUPER easy and I love how customizable everything is. 
J B.,"Morgan Hill, CA",The wait is long and the service and food is good.
Brittney D.,"Aliso Viejo, CA","The ramen here is really good, but I do think it might be a lil overhyped. The service is also great, everyone's polite and sweet. Don't expect any small talk, they're definitely efficient more than anything. We only waited 15 mins when the wait was supposed to be 45 mins, which was nice but I don't think it would've been worth a 45 min wait tbh. One thing is that I wish there was a thick noodles option, but I'm pretty sure that's not authentic so no big deal at all. Still tasted good!"
Cynthia N.,"San Jose, CA","I came here on a Sunday afternoon with a friend at around 2/3 pm, and the wait was only 20 minutes. They checked our vaxx cards and IDs, and we ordered the chicken karaage and two hakata tonkotsu (mine was mild, his was medium). The food came out in 10-15 minutes, and it was *chef's kiss*. I loved the chicken karaage accompanied with the sauce and paprika (the picture doesn't give the portion justice, as the camera did not eat first). Regarding the ramen, give a pretty decent sized portion, and I finished 3/4 of mine. I tasted some of the medium spicy broth, and I actually preferred that one more (it gives more of a kick to the taste) so next time I'll be ordering that one!"
Mary N.,"Seattle, WA",First meal after arriving  in the city and this place definitely hit the spot.
Paris O.,"San Jose, CA","Jesus! I was in Japantown and like noodles , so I stopped in . They have a bowl chicken ramen broth with a grilled chicken leg for 20 bucks . I was like I guess I will get that but it will be like 25 bucks or more if I get a coke with it. When I sat down I saw the photo below for spicy Tantan men. THAT SHIT WAS THE BITNESS! I will be coming back here for more . The girl two tables down ordered the ramen with grilled chicken .... Damn that looked and smelled good . Her shit came out sizzlin like some fajitas and Japanese people don't make fajitas . The noodles here the best texture. "
Ladi H.,"Oakland, CA",Today I went out of the norm. I ordered a small salad with plum dressing and a rice bowl with pork belly. I left fully satiated. 
Rayana F.,"San Pablo, CA",Great prices and great food. The braised pork belly is very tasteful and soft. First time here and I'm very impressed with the services. Throughout 
Daniel H.,"Gilbert, AZ","We came here on 3/30/21 around 5:45pm and there were a lot of people ahead of us on the Yelp waiting list.  We waited for about one hour before we were seated.  We ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu DX (no spicy) ($18.50), Hakata Tonkotsu DX (ultra spicy) ($18.50), Vegetable Ramen (spicy) ($15), Takoyaki ($7), and Marufuku Bites ($7)."
Jocelyn L.,"San Francisco, CA",You have to try to Marufuku bites. 10000 percent incredible. It was rich in flavor and exceeded all my expectations. Wow
Johnny V.,"San Jose, CA","Out of all the top ramens in the Bay Area, Marufuku ranks below average for me. "
Kim C.,"Round Rock, TX",Absolutely worth the wait! 
Kaitlyn L.,"Marina/Cow Hollow, San Francisco, CA",Definitely join the waitlist before you get there! It's a tiny spot and it's always packed. One of the best known ramen places in SF :) there's garage parking on the opposite side of the mall towards daiso! 
Lisa N.,"San Francisco, CA","Marufuku is my #1 favorite ramen place in the city. The wait is usually pretty long and they're currently not doing the Yelp check-in, either (you have to be physically be there to check in). I waited for 30-40 min for a table of 2 around 6:30 on a weekend. They have parking garage for the mall but it can get expensive especially with the long wait. I usually find street parking around the block. "
David Y.,"Winston-Salem, NC","The best ramen I have had and despite the many good choices in San Francisco, and even in Japan Town, the place to which I return every time I am in town."
Matthew C.,"San Diego, CA",A small ramen shop I stumbled into right as they were opening in Japan town.   Very simple menu and great service.  I ordered the chicken deluxe and it all tasted great and fresh. Gyoza was steamed and fresh.  A few decent Japanese beers on the menu.
Joyce L.,"Milpitas, CA","Long wait on weekends and around dinnertime, but easily avoidable if you come for weekday lunch! There is often no line and no need to join the waitlist. If you do want to go for dinner, come early to join the Yelp waitlist (only available at the iPad near the store front)."
Courtney S.,"Brooklyn, NY",This place is located inside the mall on the second floor. I walked up without a reservation on a Monday afternoon and was able to be seated immediately. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and hot sake.
Emma F.,"Los Angeles, CA","We came here on a weekend afternoon at around 2, hoping the wait wouldn't be too long. We weren't able to join the Yelp waitlist online, but can do so from the kiosks in front of the restaurant. The estimated wait time was around 2.5 hours, but the estimate was WILDLY off and we were able to be seated after 40 minutes. The plaza is full of shops to explore and it was easy to pass the time."
Anna Z.,"San Francisco, CA","I have attempted eating here so many times, but wait was always incredible!"
Lisa L.,"San Bruno, CA","Ordered the Ika Karage,  Tonkatsu ramen-medium spicy, and the Tonkatsu ramen deluxe-mild spicy for dining in."
Victor N.,"San Jose, CA",Yo this is the best ramen I've had in a really long time.
Michelle L.,"San Francisco, CA",9/10 
Leah S.,"Sonoma County, CA","We visited here on a trip into SF and when in SF we usually start dreaming about ramen. Hubby found Marufuku and we were able to get onto the waitlist before we arrived for lunch which proved to be absolutely a game changer due to the popularity of the restaurant. Despite being on the wait list, we did have a bit of a wait ahead of us. I love Japantown and we took that time to find some mochi and stretch our legs after the long drive. We watched as literally dozens of food delivery folks rotated through with electronic orders, and they seamlessly flowed out of the kitchen."
Nikita K.,"Fremont, CA","Had the best karaage OF MY LIFE. Honestly, it was fried to perfection, and the kewpie on the side was *chef's kiss*. Ordered the chicken paitan ramen as well and was blessed with the creamiest broth, with perfectly cooked chicken. "
Sara S.,"San Francisco, CA",This place was excellent! 
J. G.,"Santa Cruz, CA",Really enjoyed our ramen and Aki 
Urvish -.,"San Francisco, CA",This is a great place to grab some Ramen. I have been here a couple of times and the food here has always been great. I have tried their chicken ramen and vegetarian ramen. The Ramen are very delicious and the staff is exteremly helpful and jolly.
Ashley J.,"Midwest City, OK",Met my boyfriend here for dinner. I made it to the mall before him and happened to see how packed this place was so added us to the waitlist and figured we'd cancel if we went somewhere else. 
Anna D.,"San Diego, CA","The last time we were here, the line made its way all the way around that section of the mall. Looked up this place to see what all the hubbub was about and found out it was a ramen shop that people raved about. Well the third time was a charm and we ended up having an early dinner here purely out of luck."
Grace Y.,"Cerritos, CA","The broth was insanely satisfying. It was so wholesome for the belly especially when it's freezing outside. I added a side of corn, tofu and bamboo. Next time I would do the same but forgo the tofu. It tasted a little sour to me. Aside from that everything was fulfilling. "
