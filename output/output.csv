Ellie W.,"Danville, CA","Insanely good food, I got the medium spice of the ramen on the special menu and it tasted SO good. One of the best meals I've ever had in San Francisco. We also got the pork buns, oh my god. So incredibly tasty. Very quick service too. And the waiting list to get a seat was much shorter than expected, they got us a table in 10 minutes. Will definitely be going back."
Da A.,"San Francisco, CA","Hands down the most iconic ramen in SF! Located in the heart of Japantown (heck it might even be the heart of Japantown), this bustling restaurant deserves all the buzz."
Spencer Q.,"San Francisco, CA",Food: 3/5
Alison G.,"Sacramento, CA",I was craving some ramen for lunch. I decided to place a Doordash order with Marafuku Ramen. 
Nette T.,"San Francisco, CA",I haven't been to Marufuku in a minute so it was good to be back again and update my review. This time I took SO. He normally hates waiting but saw Club Mari next door (that's for another review). I put in my name on the yelp waitlist and instead of being seated in 55 minutes as it stated we were seated in 30. 
Audrey K.,"San Francisco, CA","Definitely my go-to ramen spot in Japan town. I usually get the Tonkotsu DX ultra spicy. The corn, pork belly and chashu are amazing! 10/10"
Tri D.,"Houston, TX","This is a solid spot for a bowl of ramen. The wait time can be a bit long (30 mins to an hour & 15 mins) but they have an iPad in the front entrance where you can sign up on their waiting list. Since Marufuku is inside the mall, you can wander around and check out some spots while you're killing time. I'll mention that parking isn't the best but you can park around the corner & pay the meter or your other option is the garage parking. "
Angela K.,"San Francisco, CA",One of my favorite ramen places in the city! The noodles are perfect texture and soup base is always on point. The egg was perfectly soft boiled and the tofu was nicely grilled and flavored.
Cindy B.,"Lompoc, CA","Saw really good reviews on Yelp, so we decided to give Marufuku Ramen a try. This restaurant is located in a shopping mall in Japantown. The restaurant looked modern and nice. The dining area was a bit small and tight; the dining tables were really closed to one another. My family and I came on a Monday around 1-2pm, and they were really busy. We put our name on the waitlist (approx. 45-75 min. for our party of 6), and went around shopping to kill time. They texted us 30 minutes later. Yay, shorter than what we were told! Hehe. "
Fernando F.,"San Francisco, CA",I GET THE HYPE. PERIOD. This rating on Yelp with this high of a rating leads anyone to be skeptical. What are you selling that is THIS GOOD?
Victor N.,"San Jose, CA",Yo this is the best ramen I've had in a really long time.
Leah S.,"Sonoma County, CA","We visited here on a trip into SF and when in SF we usually start dreaming about ramen. Hubby found Marufuku and we were able to get onto the waitlist before we arrived for lunch which proved to be absolutely a game changer due to the popularity of the restaurant. Despite being on the wait list, we did have a bit of a wait ahead of us. I love Japantown and we took that time to find some mochi and stretch our legs after the long drive. We watched as literally dozens of food delivery folks rotated through with electronic orders, and they seamlessly flowed out of the kitchen."
Sara S.,"San Francisco, CA",This place was excellent! 
Anthony P.,"Elmhurst, NY",The popular SF ramen spot lives up to its name! So good that they've opened up a location in NYC too
Ricky K.,"San Francisco, CA","It's time to finally update my review for Marufuku. It's been a good minute since I reviewed this place so now, I can finally give another review about it. I'm so glad I got to come back. When I came, I went inside right when they opened so I actually didn't have to wait in line at all which was very nice. I remember pre-pandemic, you would need to wait hours to even get a seat in this place. Located in the West Wing of Japantown, Marufuku does really well in executing a solid bowl of ramen and I really love the flavors and care that they incorporated into their broths. I love the modern interior as it's very Japanese inspired and it makes you feel like you're in a restaurant in Japan."
Nikita K.,"Fremont, CA","Had the best karaage OF MY LIFE. Honestly, it was fried to perfection, and the kewpie on the side was *chef's kiss*. Ordered the chicken paitan ramen as well and was blessed with the creamiest broth, with perfectly cooked chicken. "
Ashley J.,"Midwest City, OK",Met my boyfriend here for dinner. I made it to the mall before him and happened to see how packed this place was so added us to the waitlist and figured we'd cancel if we went somewhere else. 
Anna D.,"San Diego, CA","The last time we were here, the line made its way all the way around that section of the mall. Looked up this place to see what all the hubbub was about and found out it was a ramen shop that people raved about. Well the third time was a charm and we ended up having an early dinner here purely out of luck."
Grace Y.,"Cerritos, CA","The broth was insanely satisfying. It was so wholesome for the belly especially when it's freezing outside. I added a side of corn, tofu and bamboo. Next time I would do the same but forgo the tofu. It tasted a little sour to me. Aside from that everything was fulfilling. "
Kim C.,"Round Rock, TX",Absolutely worth the wait!
