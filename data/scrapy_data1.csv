Ellie W.,"Danville, CA","Insanely good food, I got the medium spice of the ramen on the special menu and it tasted SO good. One of the best meals I've ever had in San Francisco. We also got the pork buns, oh my god. So incredibly tasty. Very quick service too. And the waiting list to get a seat was much shorter than expected, they got us a table in 10 minutes. Will definitely be going back."
Zeeshan Q.,"Torrance, CA","When you enter this small shopping center you'll notice a small crowd gathered around Marifuku Ramen. Well, I'm here to tell you the hype is for real. Though wait times can be long, and seating can be cramped, the food quality is top tier. ,First off, I was pleasantly surprised that they had a very popular (and delicious) chicken paitan ramen. The chicken itself was very unique in taste, as if it had been steamed. The noodles were nice and soft, and the broth was flavorful. The Karaage was also lightly friend and paired perfectly with the mayo sauce. My friends noted that their pork ramen/chasu were delicious, and a tad bit sweet. I definitely enjoyed my visit, probably the best meal I had in San Francisco, and look forward to visiting again when I'm in the area."
Jay A.,"San Francisco, CA","I'm really disappointed with my order to go with them.,An hour ago I ordered 2 tonkotsu dx to go, and since I am a loyal Marufuku goer, I knew about how big the portion is, and since it was too late to dine in, I got my car and went to the store to pick the order myself. ,Got home, opened the containers, and had a really bad surprise when I saw the size of those portions (I even said something about the size of it over the phone, and asked DX because it was hypothetically bigger...) I still cannot describe how frustrated and upset I am.,I'm the type of ramen fan that will yell north south west east how good the place is, share stories, share with friends and family, and do my fan paper... I will keep the same words about Marufuku quality, of course, but size-wise, I will surely add that: IF YOU WANT TO HAVE THE REAL EXPERIENCE WHEN IT COMES FOR THE PORTION, DO NOT ASK YOUR ORDER TO GO, GO THERE FOR DINE IN! Otherwise, you will pay for a dish, and get a mini version of it.,I should add a note in here that I paid 50$ for 2 baby ramens + extra noodles, plus, my girlfriend who never finishes a plate, miraculously finished  It was probably a miracle or so lol"
Nuno S.,"San Francisco, CA","To start let me say that I'm a big fan of Marufuku food. Something really sad happened though that I found very hard for me to ever forget. ,Two visitors from abroad and they wanted to try ramen. So I decided to take them to one of the places I like the most in the city for ramen - Marufuku. ,One of the visitors with me is a recovering cancer patient on crutches with limited resistance. ,We went there and there was a 60 min wait. We patiently waited outside for our turn. Our visitor after a while started struggling to wait in the hardwood benches. I went to the restaurant, explained the situation and asked if at least they could lend us a padded chair for her to wait. The answer was NO! There was absolutely no understanding or willingness to attend to the specific circumstance. ,While the situation was getting more difficult for her, we still kept waiting until we were already way past the 60 mins that were initially mentioned. I went again to the restaurant / manager and they kept an absolute inflexible position about it... to the point that my visitor recovering from her condition was about to leave because she just couldn't handle the wait without a proper seat anymore. It was already past some 80 mins and me going various times to check how much longer so they could still try my favorite ramen place that they finally, with very resistance, gave us a place to seat... ,The food was still good. The experience was ruined... my respect for this organization and their manager absolutely crushed.  ,If you have another Ramen Place that has amazing food AND EMPATHY and some level of HUMANITY please pvt message me!,This is currently my favorite ramen place in town. Their ramen is really good and the chicken Kaarage is also very good. ,I always get the special ramen bowl with an extra of the tasty chicken. ,Thing to bear in mind is their lines are ridiculously long!!! They are supposed to have Yelp Wait service in which you should be able to get your name on line through the app but it never works for me. ,If you don't mind the wait it's totally worth it!"
Spencer Q.,"San Francisco, CA","Food: 3/5,Service: 4/5,Ambiance: 3.5/5,Overall: A bit of a wait for this place.  I felt like the Oakland location was better., ,The extended review..., ,Food:,Chicken Karaage - 3/5 - Some decent fried chicken.  Pretty standard fare.,Hakata Tonkatsu Dx - 3/5 - I would go for the Chicken Paidan instead.  The pork belly was definitely nice and tender but pretty standard fare compared to other places., ,Service: 4/5 - Friendly and attentive service., ,Ambiance:  4/5 - The ambiance was nice but it was very tight for seating."
Da A.,"San Francisco, CA","Hands down the most iconic ramen in SF! Located in the heart of Japantown (heck it might even be the heart of Japantown), this bustling restaurant deserves all the buzz.,The Hakata Tonkotsu is the star. The soup is rich and flavorful, the medium-thick semi-curly noodles are an amazing texture, and the egg is cooked perfectly. The only component which is a little underwhelming is the default chashu pork that comes with it.,During busy times, you can join the yelp waitlist and explore Japantown while you wait. Takeout is a good option to avoid the long line, but it definitely compromises the overall experience and taste"
Nette T.,"San Francisco, CA","I haven't been to Marufuku in a minute so it was good to be back again and update my review. This time I took SO. He normally hates waiting but saw Club Mari next door (that's for another review). I put in my name on the yelp waitlist and instead of being seated in 55 minutes as it stated we were seated in 30. ,I was glad that I came with SO because he was hungry which meant that I could order more food. We ordered:,Chicken Karaage: Fried chicken was crunchy and juicy on the inside. Very tasty. ,Pan Fried Pot Stickers: These were also very good and the bottom of the pot sticker was crunchy.,Marufuku Bites (steamed buns filled with homemade pork chashu): The bun came with chopped up chasu, green onions and Kewpie mayo. It was actually pretty filling and I only ate half because I was waiting for my ramen and didn't want to spoil my appetite.,Hakata Tonkotsu DX (chashu pork, seasoned soft boiled egg, green onions, kikurage mushrooms, bean sprouts, braised thick pork belly, corn, and nori seaweed): He ordered Mild spicy, I ordered Medium spicy. Ramen came in a short amount of time and I dug in. The soup had depth and was flavorful.  Hakata style noodles were cooked al dente, and the toppings of pork and veggies were great went well together in texture and taste. It's just as good as I remembered. ,Service was on point so no complaints there. This is on definite rotation when I'm in the mood for ramen.,I wanted to try Marufuku Ramen from all the great reviews, and it did not disappoint. I put my name down and we ended up waiting 30 minutes which isn't too bad because we were able to walk around and look at the various shops around the restaurant.,We ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen.  The ramen came in less then 5 minutes and I took a sip of the soup and immediately knew that this was good ramen. The soup had the depth and complexity of it being cooked for many hours.  The noodles were chewy and on the thin side but that is expected of Hakata style ramen.,I'd recommend going there when it first opens to get the first seating. But if not, waiting 30 minutes or more at a mall that has lots of shops to pass the time isn't so bad."
Tri D.,"Houston, TX","This is a solid spot for a bowl of ramen. The wait time can be a bit long (30 mins to an hour & 15 mins) but they have an iPad in the front entrance where you can sign up on their waiting list. Since Marufuku is inside the mall, you can wander around and check out some spots while you're killing time. I'll mention that parking isn't the best but you can park around the corner & pay the meter or your other option is the garage parking. ,Let's move on to the food, I decided to order the Gyoza which comes with 7 pieces ($7). & The Hakata Tonkotsu (spicy). The gyoza was decent, it was moist on the inside & lightly fried on the outside. It was a little undercooked on the outside, because I can taste that gummy consistency. The Tonkotsu was worth the wait, it was creamy, rich, aromatic, good amount of spice & wasn't too salty. The noodles could've been firmer but it still had a good chew to it. The chashu wasn't that tendered but it was seasoned very nicely. The egg was cooked perfectly, which is runny on the inside. I would've liked it better if they marinated/seasoned the eggs because it just tasted like a regular soft boiled egg to me.,Overall good food, nice & quick service & beautiful decor. They also have the ""DX"" Hakata Tonkotsu which has buta kakuni & that's the better cut of pork belly. ,Tip: they have the Chicken Paitan ""DX"" which has only 15 servings per day, it must be good since that's the amount they sell per day. I'll give it a try when I'm in town again."
Audrey K.,"San Francisco, CA","Definitely my go-to ramen spot in Japan town. I usually get the Tonkotsu DX ultra spicy. The corn, pork belly and chashu are amazing! 10/10,The gyoza are okay. Light crisp, not too big, just ok.."
Angela K.,"San Francisco, CA","One of my favorite ramen places in the city! The noodles are perfect texture and soup base is always on point. The egg was perfectly soft boiled and the tofu was nicely grilled and flavored.,I absolutely loved the spinach noodle, tasted just like normal ramen but definitely felt like a health queen."
Erin L.,"San Francisco, CA","We ordered takeout through Uber eats and the food came quickly and was still warm. ,We ordered the Chicken Paitan, Hakata Tonkotsu DX, and Takoyaki. Everything was absolutely delicious. Many times Chicken Paitan doesn't have much flavor, but I found it had as much flavor as the Tonkotsu broth. I was weary of the Takoyaki as I am not a big fan of Bonita flakes but I would order it again. ,We followed the instructions provided to heat up the broth and it was the perfect temperature. The packaging of the ramen was really ingenious. It ensured all of the components were cooked beautifully once you put everything together. ,Overall, we will definitely be ordering from here again and will  go to the restaurant in the future to get the full experience."
David Z.,"Santa Clara, CA","I'm a ramen expert and Marufuku ramen is one of the best I have ever tried.,The noodle has perfect tenderness, the soup is the best part, and the pork is delicious.  At my age I think the portion size is perfect. :D,we also had the shishito peppers and they were good."
Mariana C.,"Point Loma, San Diego, CA","Good service and amazing food! They have a wait list but not too crazy I had to wait just 30min to get in. Staffs are friendly and so polity. To start I we ordered the fried shishito pepper really interested and my entre was the vegetarian ramen. Broth was on point (mild), perfect egg and delicious noodles, make your stomach calm and happy. Delicious experience!"
Ella C.,"SoMa, San Francisco, CA","My new favorite ramen place in SF!! I ordered the spicy miso ramen and it was amazing. It was the perfect amount of spice. We joined the Yelp waitlist before leaving the house, so we didn't end up having to wait for very long. The staff was very friendly!"
Masayan T.,"San Jose, CA","The great thing about this restaurant is not the ramen's taste, but that the atmosphere, the way the restaurant is built, and the training of the staff are excellent.,I am not saying that the ramen is bad; the ramen itself is very simple and ""OK"". However, judging from the speed at which the store has been opened and the number of fans and reviews, it is not hard to imagine that the management team of this restaurant has been working very hard.,I'd give the ramen a 50, but considering the service and management, I'd give it a 75 in total."
Anya S.,"Ashland, OR",Delicious tonkatsu ramen and fried squid! Portions were fair and the food came out quickly after being seated.
Kelly S.,"San Jose, CA","Yumm!!,We ended our weekend trip (for my bday) at this ramen/udon spot! It was so pretty good!! ,We got: ,- udon ,- creamy salmon udon: taste like pasta. So creamy and it also comes with cheese! It does get sickening half way through tho,- guozo: pretty good! Panned fried 'dumpling',- hot sake: pretty good! Different.. but hits the spot ,I would definitely come back if other places were closed or we were craving udon and we were in the city. Parking is a little hard to find but all is not too bad. ,They're located in a building with other vendors; ramen, ice cream, book store, etc!"
Alondra M.,"GILLEM ENCLAVE, GA","Zero stars. Ordered via Uber eats because I was craving a spicy ramen on a cold day ... I asked for spicy and it was just the normal broth. I added corn and didn't receive it, everything was Luke warm (I usually order ramen on Uber eats from further places and it's never this cold. ,Def won't be ordering from this place again. ,The noodles were also very hard, 20cent ramen noodles taste better than this"
Kamryn W.,"Danville, CA","Warning: do not come here unless you're prepared to have ramen ruined for you because nothing else will ever compare. It is consistently the best ramen I've ever had. ,Cute hidden gem in a shopping mall in Japantown. Expect to wait 1-2 hours for your table. Get there early and get on the waitlist asap, and then wander around the shops as you wait. In my experience the table will be ready much sooner than they say, so don't wander too far. ,I love the tonkotsu ramen and the bourbon aged sake, but really you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"
Jenn W.,"San Jose, CA","For such a highly reviewed and rated place, I had way higher hopes than the 4 stars I am giving this place.  I would actually give it 3.5 if I could but decided to round up since service was prompt and nice.  ,I got the Marufuku bites and the Hakata Tonkotsu DX.  The best thing about the bowl of ramen was the chashu pork slices.  They were flavorful pieces of pork that I wanted more of.  The rest of the components of the ramen including the noodles were only ok.  Also, I ordered the ramen in spicy since I was scared of ultra spicy but I could have totally done ultra spicy since I did not think spicy was that spicy.  I won't be rushing back here since I think there are way better ramen options elsewhere."
Vanessa C.,"Rohnert Park, CA","WOW! This has been the best ramen I have ever had in my life. While there is a pretty long wait, there's a lot to do that the wait is not even that bad. We got seated pretty quickly after we received a text that we were off the waitlist. The staff was super nice. We ordered two bowls of tonkotsu and some gyozas (7 pieces). Our food came out super quick!! The broth of the ramen was super rich and my tummy felt so happy after our meal. Definitely recommend coming here if you have the chance"
Joh E.,"Milpitas, CA","Hakata Tonkotsu  DX and Takoyaki ,plus Dx RamenDx RamenHakata DxHakata TonkotsuTakoyakiservice is superb.,They don't use MSG in their food ,unlike other ramen spots that i've been too, ,its always makes me drowsy after eating."
Idy C.,"Vallejo, CA","Way overdue for this ramen place in Japan town San Francisco. Went there Las time and they were completely full and we didn't get to even wait. Finally returned back this time and was able to join waitlist with Yelp at the store. (They don't take reservations and you cannot join waitlist in advance.) wait time was about 45 mins so we were just checking out places in the plaza. ,Ramen! They were delicious. The bowl looked small but the portion was huge! I love the pork soup base and they were very tasty. Egg was cooked on point. Definitely will go back next time.,Parking maybe a little headache on the weekend since everyone is coming out after reopening. Just be patient and there were plenty parking in the structure!"
Isabelle D.,"Las Vegas, NV","Seriously the best ramen in Japantown- probably the best ramen in SF. I hate to say it, but it even made me forget about my favorite ramen back in Vegas too. ,Got there during lunch hour so there was a 30 minute wait, which really wasn't bad at all. The veggie ramen was the best I've had- no skimming out on the flavors or toppings at all. I stole some scoops of my brother's Hakata Tonkotsu too and the broth is unbelievable. You can also adjust your spice level, choose extra toppings, and order extra noodles. The menu also has rice bowls, salads, and small side orders like gyoza. The chicken karaage is a must if you're considering sides- so crispy without over-breading the chicken. And it's SO filling- had to get my ramen to go and had the urge to eat it as soon as we left. ,The staff is really good about their Bay Area hospitality and the dining area is gorgeous. It's located in the Japantown plaza, along with a bunch of other ramen and udon restaurants, even a Benihana, but trust me- this is the one you want to go to"
Rayana F.,"San Pablo, CA","Great prices and great food. The braised pork belly is very tasteful and soft. First time here and I'm very impressed with the services. Throughout ,eating they clean off your table which is very nice. ,I ended up getting the Braid pork bowl(Kakuni Bowl) and the pork belly buns (Marufuku Bites '2 for 8' . The buns were really soft and creamy from the mayo. And the stamps were a cute gesture. The bowl was a perfect size at the time I went. I was only looking for snack sized meals, this is good if you don't have a huge appetite. The braised pork bowl came with raw veggies with I wasn't a fan of but it does balance out the pork well. That was just preference thing."
Hannah W.,"Philadelphia, PA","The restaurant was not taking any walk-ins and all orders needed to be placed online (it was PACKED). No big deal because the weather was beautiful and there were plenty of places to sit outside in the promenade area. ,Bao buns and takoyaki were outstanding! Tonkotsu had nice flavor!"
Nina Z.,"San Diego, CA","The waiting line for this place perfectly explains how good it is! We went on a weekend and they said that the wait would be around an hour to an hour and a half, but fortunately it ended up being around 45 minutes. The servers were very polite and the food came pretty quickly.,We ordered their Takoyaki, Kakuni Bowl, and Hakata Tonkotsu, and it was honestly the perfect amount for two people. And can you believe that the Kakuni Bowl was only $5?! It was such a thick piece of meat that was absolutely delicious! So if the amount of people lined up to eat here doesn't convince you to go, maybe the $5 Kakuni Bowl will :)"
Alisha W.,"San Francisco, CA","Best Ramen in San Francisco & Northern California!!,Period! Always consistent, never a bad batch! So so good!  the only ramen I'll eat!"
Sophia N.,"New Haven, CT","Cute Japantown staple. Ramen is pretty good and very reasonably priced. I came at 2:30 on a Tuesday and still had a 30 minute wait. Of course, there's lots to do in the two malls. ,I ordered the veggie ramen and ika karage (fried squid). The noodles have a spinach base which gives them a fun green color. ,As a caveat, I will say that if I just had a 30 minute wait for this restaurant sitting by the host stand, I don't think the ramen be worth the wait. It's warm and filling, but I didn't think it was particularly special (I can only speak to the veggie ramen),If you have a long wait, I would recommend stopping by the conveyor belt sushi place as a quick appetizer."
Vanessa H.,"Palmdale, CA","So delicious!! It was our second time here, and our experience was just as amazing as the first! Hands down, the best ramen we've ever had. Just know that this place is always busy, so be prepared to wait about an hour. I recommend joining the waitlist through yelp and then looking around the little shops in Japan town while waiting. They send you a text when your table is ready. Also, the servers are so attentive and kind! :)"
Krissy M.,"San Francisco, CA",So good! Had the vegetable ramen with tofu chashu and was shocked at how delicious it was!
Charlotte C.,"San Francisco, CA","Amazingly rich and flavorful ramen! Came here with family and most of us ordered the hakata tonkotsu DX. First sip of the broth immediately convinced me. It was super rich, flavorful, yet not greasy at all. The egg (always one of my favorite parts of ramen) was perfectly cooked with that semi runny yolk. The corn, red ginger, and seaweed were all amazing complements. There's also a thick slice of braised pork belly and 2 thinner pieces, all were so so soft and melts in your mouth. ,We also order chicken karaage and squid karaage. Unsurprisingly they were juicy and tasty appetizers that were well liked by everyone.,They currently don't take reservations so you need to put your name on the waitlist. Twice I was told that the wait was 70-100 minutes, but our table was usually ready in 20-30 minutes, which isn't too bad as there are a lot of cute stores to walk around in the mall"
Elena W.,"Millbrae, CA","I'm probably going to be in the minority here by saying that I think the ramen at Marufuku is just okay. To me, it's not as spectacular as everyone else makes it out to be.,The broth is super rich, which holds true to their long preparation period, but to me it was too salty. Also, I like a bit of a thicker noodle and the ramen noodles here were on the thin side. All of the other ingredients in the ramen were great though: perfectly soft boiled ramen egg and savory cha shu. ,So though I wasn't the biggest fan of their ramen, I did really like the karaage and takoyaki appetizers here! I would totally come here just for the appetizers and not for the ramen lol. The karaage was lightly breaded and the chicken was juicy. The takoyaki was super hot (which is how takoyaki should be enjoyed, if a takoyaki ball doesn't burn my mouth then it's automatically not good) and tasted super delicious as well. ,In terms of the experience, my friends and I had to wait quite a while before we got seated. It was a Saturday night after all. They were so busy that they actually stopped letting people join the wait list at 7PM (they close at 9PM, that's how behind they were on their waiting list omg). I felt pretty safe dining here during COVID because the wait staff did temperature checks, they were wearing masks, they wiped down the table in front of us, and we were seated 6 feet apart from other tables. All of the wait staff were friendly and earnestly doing their jobs.,My final verdict is that I wouldn't come here on my own accord, but if my friends wanted to come here I wouldn't be opposed to going with them."
Elizabeth L.,"San Francisco, CA","Finally was able to try this ramen place despite being an SF local, and my only regret was not trying it sooner! Usually I am deterred from their long lines and small interior, but the food is definitely worth it. They have a kiosk where you can join their yelp waitlist where you can get texted when your table is ready. Went on a Sunday morning around noon and was able to get a table within half an hour.,I ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu DX, which comes with a rather large chunk of meat. The broth was so rich without being overly salty, and the noodles were cooked to the perfect texture. It's honestly a big portion of food, and worth the hefty price tag. Next time I may just get the non-DX version. The food came within a few minutes of us ordering, and the servers were super attentive to refilling water, getting our check, etc."
Jacqueline M.,"Phoenix, AZ","Best Ramen in San Francisco.,On a rainy day in SF, when the cold wraps it's chilly arms around you, wrap your hands around a large steaming bowl of Tonkotsu Ramen at the Marufuku Location in Japan town.  A cost, intimate space tucked into the second story corner of the Japanese Mall.,There is always a wait here...we waited 45 min to slurp this very savory authentic Hakata-style Tonkotsu ramen -- Creamy, umami rich broth made from boiling pork bones for long hours -and Cha-shu made from specially selected pork.,Hands down, the best!"
Daniel D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY","The ramen here is definitely the best in SF but it's nothing mind-blowing. I would not wait more than half an hour for this. I've heard the wait time gets to be a couple hours on busier weekends and you can surely fly to LA, eat, and come back in less time.,The deluxe chicken paitan comes with a grilled piece of chicken leg and it's definitely a 1.5x portion. The hakata deluxe has an extra slice of pork belly and is really amazing too. I think it's worth it to try both at least once."
Yuxuan H.,"Cary, NC","4.5/5,The ramen and the pipirika fried chicken are both great, but the drinks are okay and pricy. We all found the kimino drinks almost tasteless (not recommend),Staff were friendly and helped ordered 1 and a half orders of the pipirika chicken for us three to share. The walk-in wait-list is about 40min so definitely grab a spot before heading to other shops nearby!"
Lillian B.,"San Francisco, CA","Overall a good ramen spot, but nothing out of the ordinary that you couldn't get at other ramen places in the city. SF has so many! ,I prefer a thicker noodle and they mostly use thin ones here. Their tonkotsu is good but I've had better. I did love their spicy chicken tan tan men which in my opinion was more flavorful! And they use thick noodles! It might be a seasonal menu item though. ,It's almost always booked up once the restaurant opens, but they have a Yelp waitlist that you can add yourself to in advance. On a Tuesday evening at 6pm, we probably had to wait about 10 minutes which is not bad at all! The only downside is more people started coming later so the servers kind of rushed us in terms of clearing our plates and getting us our check (and even checked in on us while we were finishing up drinks)."
Heidi L.,"Clifton, VA","I just want to put it out there that this is by far the best ramen I ever had.,This ramen shop is located inside of the mall of Japanese town in San Francisco. This was one of the popular spot for good ramen place within San Francisco downtown. Many foodies on social media had mention this place so I had to give it a try. ,My fiancé and I tried the most popular entrees and chicken karaage. Despite the fact that we were so full from eating around the trip, we thoroughly enjoyed the food. My fiancé especially is not a fan of starchy carby entrees but even he agreed that the food was too good. ,I don't need to say too much. The ramen is almost like a comfort food of Japan. It definitely helped me warm up in the cold wind of San Francisco weather. If you want to try the full experience, try to aim for weekdays early dinner time. No wait needed. You will be seated right away. Making a reservation is another way to tackle. ,Whoever is in town of Japan at San Francisco should definitely get a good bowl of ramen! Two thumbs up :)))))"
Gina G.,"Oakland, CA","I think of this ramen often...it's so bomb and worth the wait! That broth is a god send and I can't wait to go bacK,Oh and whatever they do to the octopus balls is insane. A must try"
Xiaoying S.,"Stanford, CA","Went there for the first time a few weeks ago. We heard it's a really popular restaurant so we joined the waitlist on Yelp which helped a lot. We were late for our table but there was luckily a table available when we arrived. I ordered the basic Hakata ramen with added tofu, and tried the gyoza and takoyaki as well. Maybe my expectation was too high, I didn't feel the ramen was that impressive (I also prefer wilder ramen noodles). The ramen bowl was surely interesting. I would not recommend the gyoza, and takoyaki was just so-so."
Britney H.,"Washington, DC","Could rave about this place forever. The best veggie ramen I've had!! I love the noodles here. So chewy and delicious. And the broth was chefs kiss. I'm also really happy with the anount of vegetables they put in the vegetable ramen! Lots of arugula, bell peppers, and onion.  My favorite part is that they put a soft boiled egg in automatically--no more adding eggs at an extra charge!!,Friends agree that the takoyaki was solid 8/10. Great flavor and nice snack with the ramen. ,Would definitely return here and vegetarians please go try the ramen here!"
Michelle C.,"San Francisco, CA",I wasn't sure what to expect before trying Marufuku but it seemed to be the most popular and highest rated ramen spot in town. Personally I prefer a richer broth and thicker noodles but it's a really good Hakata style ramen! It's very tasty and deceptively filling for how big the bowl looks. The service was very friendly and attentive. The takoyaki was also delicious. The wait ended up being quite a bit shorter than it said when we first checked in (about 30 min rather than 60-80 min).
Allison G.,"SoMa, San Francisco, CA","I LOVE Marufuku so much. They have the best tonkatsu! Great service, super quick and friendly!"
Donna R.,"Berkeley, CA","Delicious! I recommend the Hakata Tonkotsu DX, medium spicy! It's got everything you would want in Ramen. And I really enjoyed the ambiance inside of the restaurant."
Daisy T.,"San Francisco, CA","As an SF native, I don't know why it took me so long to try Marufuku. I am embarrassed to admit this!!! ,First of all, the service was efficient, helpful, and friendly. Our server recommended a green matcha tea with our ramen, and it was so perfectly refreshing against the rich ramen broth. I really wanted to try the chicken dx ramen but they sold out for the day. Still, the Hakata tonkatsu Dx was amazing and a straight winner for me. The broth was flavorful and rich, the meat was juicy and very tender. The ramen was overall very flavorful and is definitely a new favorite for me in SF.,We also ordered chicken karaage and marafuku bites for appetizers. Both were also delicious snacks to prep for the main ramen course. The karaage was skin crisp and very juicy to the bite. The marafuku bites had great flavor, although I thought the small meat pieces were a little tougher to chew through. All in all, still a really delicious meal and I plan to be back!"
Ivy K.,"Salinas, CA",Delicious i go all the time beware sat sun and friday super busy i waited 2+ hours once
Rachel Z.,"Los Angeles, CA","It is the best ramen in big bay area!,The soup and very rich and thin port belly is melting in mouth so smoothly."
Michael C.,"San Jose, CA","Been here several times...never been disappointed...,Very popular Ramen spot in SF Japan Town...I'd say it's the most popular spot...I've never seen a 2 hour wait at any surrounding Ramen spots. You cn jump on the wait list through Yelp, even that closes at times! NUTS!!! Pre-pandemic of course...these days its a bit easier to get a seat inside. ,""Marufuku proudly serves the authentic Hakata-style Tonkotsu ramen -- featuring milky and umami rich broth made from boiling pork bones for long hours, an ultra-thin artisanal noodles that match perfectly with the broth, and Cha-shu made from specially selected pork.,Rich white chicken paitan ramen with chicken Cha-shu is also featured on the menu along with variety of mini-sized rice bowls, izakaya-style appetizers, and premium beer & sake."",Stolen from the website:,The foodie stuff:,~ Pirikara Chicken Bites - 5/5,Only on the SEASONAL SPECIALS menu! I do hope they keep this appetizer around or add it to the regular menu. The Chicken was perfectly done and complimented the sauces in the bun. Brilliant little appetizer!,~ Spicy Tan Tan Men - 4.5/5,My biggest issue with this dish was the lack of ground Chicken. I felt like they skimped on the portions of Ground Chicken. Other than that...a perfect bowl or Ramen! Squeezing the Lemon in the soup changes the flavor as well...delish! ,~ Hakata Tonkotsu (Spicy) - 4.5/5,Definitely spicy! Especially if you ask for it on the spicy side...makes you choke when your try to inhale the soup...yet sooo good!,~ Hakata Tonkotsu DX - 4.5/5,Flavor Galore...Basically a perfect bowl of Ramen. INHO, more enjoyable when it's not as spicy.,~ Chicken Paitan DX - 4/5,They only make 15 orders of this dish a day! So try to come a bit earlier to get this one! Chicken ramen with rich white ""paitan"" broth...to me its not as flavorful as the ""rich pork broth"" still very tasty. The DX also comes with a ""grilled chicken leg on a sizzling plate, sweet corn, and nori seaweed."" - 5/5,The best value! They give you a fair bit more than the chicken leg. Grilled to perfection, the chicken is a brilliant add on. Bring an appetite for this one!"
Jon J.,"Los Angeles, CA","Best Ramen experience in my life!!,Best professional and attentive wait staff!!,Small, straight forward menu is a sign that this place makes the best ramen in the city.,Located in Japan town.,Will definitely go back"
Garima G.,"Santa Clara, CA","Tried the mild vegetarian Ramen and my husband had the spicy tantan men. Both were delicious. Both me and My husband added more chilli oil to the ramen.,I think I can take medium easily next time. ,I liked the noodles in the spicy tantan men more."
Xiaopan X.,"Ontario, CA","I want to let you know that this place made me love ramen and noodles. I do not really like ramen like that... it'll was never something I craved. Now, I crave Marafuku often and cry that we don't live in SF. (I'm in Socal, so the ramen is plentiful here, but I haven't found anything like Marufuku.),We were on vacation and it was a cold and foggy day (I gotta set the scene y'all) and ramen sounded good. We headed there also the try the Chicken Paitan since they only serve so many in a day.,I got the HAKATA TONKOTSU DX and my wife got the regular HAKATA TONKOTSU and we were both blown away. The meat was so tender and flavorful and the broth was *chef's kiss* - creamy but not too fatty. My egg was perfectly done... juicy and oozing out. YUM! I got my ramen medium level of spicy and it was perfect - I like some heat but I'm not the type of person to like super spicy or numbingly spicy things. Chicken Paitan was really good - the flavor is sweet and salty and juicy and tender - perfect for sharing between two or even three people (if it's more of a side dish haha... don't just get the chicken bc then it won't be enough to fill you up if you're sharing)! ,If you're traveling, definitely give this place a try especially if it's cold outside."
Cindy L.,"Atlanta, GA","My first meal ever in SF was here and it did not disappoint my mouth nor tummy! Their ramen has flat noodles, but the broth did not wow me. The charsiu pork was so soft and melty in my mouth. Fresh beansprouts and gingers to complement the savory ramen. Egg was a perfect soft boil. My favorite thing about this spot is their chicken karage... so crispy and a punch of flavor!"
Naina S.,"San Francisco, CA","I finally was able to try Marufuku on-site with their indoor seating. I recommend allocating 1.5 hours prior to sitting, after you check-in and get on the Yelp waitlist at the entrance. You can easily walk around Japantown and kill time exploring the shops. ,Their new Chicken TanTan ramen had a lot of good flavor and was really good. The Tonkatsu was really good as per usual too. ,The ramen was more fresh at the restaurant vs. their takeout, which is to be expected.,I tried Marufuku to-go for the first time during this pandemic. I had my expectations low because I was afraid it was over-hyped by friends and Yelp ratings. However, even to-go, their ramen blew me away. The broth was so flavorful and also felt unique to them. I got the Chicken Paitan and my roommate for the Tonkatsu, both of them really good! Next time, I think I'm going to get the Tonkatsu for myself. I'm also really picky with ramen noodles but their's were really good, I loved them. The soft-boiled egg was also cooked to perfection."
Beth K.,"Pacifica, CA","Ordered takeout for dinner on a Wednesday evening, and was pleased with everything. Marufuku has their takeout game on point--noodles and toppings packaged separately, soup was piping hot and wrapped securely, all condiments, utensils, and napkins were included, separate line for take-out orders from the restaurant dine-in line. ,Great ramen--flavorful soup with richness and depth, fresh noodles, flavorful toppings, combined together for a super satisfying meal.,Also ordered a karaage bowl for my kid who hasn't quite grown to appreciate a hot bowl of noodles yet (in time, kiddo, in time). Also tried the Marufuku bites, which are pork chasu nestled in steamed pillowy baos. ,Service was friendly and efficient. Really couldn't ask for more! Well done, Marufuku Ramen team!"
Kristi C.,"Vallejo, CA","Yum, double yum. Delicious ramen, chicken and more. Service was incredible. I had the spicy ground chicken ramen and it was amazing.  We also had the chicken ramen which comes with a whole chicken quarter. We had the chicken buns as well. On a side note, we parked in the garage, took the elevator to the 3rd floor. When u exit, it's immediately next to the restaurant."
Jocelyn L.,"San Francisco, CA",You have to try to Marufuku bites. 10000 percent incredible. It was rich in flavor and exceeded all my expectations. Wow
Kristina P.,"Hercules, CA","Hands down, the best ramen I've had in the Bay Area. And I think I definitely ruined the expectation from other ramen spots because I will always compare it to Marufuku.,The portions are extremely generous and the staff are very kind and attentive. I got the Hakata Tonkotsu DX and the broth was immaculate. This bowl of ramen was so delicious--I still dream about it and wish I lived closer to Japantown. We also ordered the takoyaki and it was superb. Overall, the food was delish, the ambiance was warm and cozy and though the waits are long, it's worth it. Will be back and highly recommend!"
Paul H.,"Oakland, CA","There was a lot of hype around this restaurant.  ,I had been to a few other ramen spots and was curious to see whether it would exceed expectation. We were required to put our name on a waitlist using the iPad/Yelp software tool provided. I received a phone text message indicating that our table was ready.  I would suggest not going too FSR from the restaurant as they require that you return for seating within 5 minutes of being alerted.  Once seated, we were able to quickly order and the food was provided in less than 10 minutes !  The waitress suggested ordering the Hakata Tonkotau as it was the most popular item with brith choices of mild, medium and spicy. Breaking down the ramen comparisons - the noodles were rather thin when compared to other places I had been, the broth was flavorful but not a thick/hearty and veggies were good.  I also notified that fresh ginger had been added which was a twist and provided some additional flavor. Overall the ramen was good but not the best that I've tasted.  I also noticed that I was drinking a lot of water which leads me to believe that there is more sodium than other ramen I've had.  That being said I would go again and try."
Elena A.,"Mountain View, CA","Super delighted after trying this place for the first time! You do have to wait a little bit but honestly our wait was pretty minimal (maybe about 20 minutes), but I do think we were probably just lucky. The food was incredible and super satisfying. Nothing like a hot bowl of ramen when it's cold outside! The service was also very nice and they were super attentive to us. Each ingredient in the bowl had attention to detail and I was very happy overall!"
Benny H.,"San Jose, CA","Damn good ramen. The wait can be long. Real long, but it's worth it. ,Probably the most popular spot in SF Japantown, and again for good reason. The ramen is simply amazing and their spicy broth will knock you out. ,Overall, fantastic experience."
Emma L.,"Sacramento, CA","The BEST ramen in SF undoubtedly! Marufuku has been my family's go-to ramen spot for the past few years and rightfully so. ,Wait can be quite long during popular hours but are manageable otherwise. There have been times i've gone at 12pm and waited well over an hour and other times i've come at 3pm and waited 10 minutes.,Regardless - it's worth any wait. The quality of food is very good, especially for the price. More affordable than a lot of other spots in the area. The broth alone has me driving all the way from walnut creek.,Since eating here, it has become increasingly more difficult to enjoy other ramen spots because they don't compare to Marufuku.,Highly recommend!"
Nicole W.,"San Francisco, CA","First stop after loving to the bay is this classic! As always, Marafuku was delicious with a great broth and even better pork belly - two things essential for a good ramen. ,If you're going to eat here, I would highly recommend the Yelp Waitlist. If you sign up in person, they'll put you on the waitlist anyways. The wait can get pretty long especially on the weekend so sign up ahead! If the online one is full, the in person waitlist was still taking reservations when I was there. Expect probably at least an hour, although the waitlist usually moves faster than what it estimates. We arrived later than the waitlist said, and they still held our table!,The service here is very quick - we got our food and ate it quickly because we were starving haha. Like I said - everything was delicious, and you can't really seem to go wrong."
Leah C.,"San Francisco, CA","Someone back at home in Hawaii highly recommended this place. Luckily when we swung by there wasn't a wait so we got seated pretty quickly. Seating is a bit tight. I wouldn't recommend any larger parties. Menu options were pretty straightforward. Husband got the spicy tan tan and I got the Hakata Tonkotsu. Overall tasty, standard portions. Sorry no picture for mine because I couldn't wait to dig in hahaha. FYI tan tan noodles are thicker while hakata noodles were thinner. Delicious though! Hit the spot if you are craving Japanese ramen. For Hawaii folks, it's similar to Agu Ramen with price point and flavor. I was curious about trying the $5 bowls they have on the menu but no one around us ordered that so maybe next time!"
Jelena L.,"Denver, CO","Oh yeah, this hit the spot! We came in early right at 5pm, and the restaurant was always packed. Luckily they had one table left, so we got seated immediately. Service was excellent. Super friendly people, and food came out quick. Perfect Ramen! Absolute perfection! Yummy! The buns and gyoza was delicious as well. Will definitely come back when visiting San Francisco."
Sherry S.,"San Francisco, CA","I can't believe I've lived in SF for 1 1/2 years and this was my first time having Marufuku Ramen. I've been missing out on these PERFECTLY textured noods.  Their takeout during the pandemic is ready super quickly, is packaged great and travels well.,The Hakata Tonkotsu DX is the way to go. It's their regular Hakata Tonkatsu ramen but upgraded with additional toppings:  braised thick pork belly, corn, and nori seaweed."
Maurice C.,"CA, CA","We did enjoy the food. The Ramen that I ordered had great noodle texture, a little firmer which I liked, and the toppings were great and were cooked pretty well. The eggs were cooked to perfection with soft, creamy insides. The bowl was too big for me to finish completely though I tried my best! We will definitely be back."
Sarah T.,"San Francisco, CA","Goodness... the line here is always outrageous but rightly so. The Hakata style ramen here has the right amount of depth, flavor, and fattiness that you look for in a great tonkatsu broth. I especially love that they give you option to add more noodles to your dish! It's something I loved about eating ramen in Japan. ,My only qualm is that they only serve their ramen with traditional thin noodles. I would love a thicker chewier noodle, but this is a very small detail. Their noodles are still very delicious and do a great job of picking up the flavor of the soup. This gets you that flavor in every bite. ,In Japan many ramen restaurants don't allow you to change the integrity of the bowl. No swaps ‍ Perhaps it's for the best. Enjoy it the way it was traditionally meant to be enjoyed and forget the 'starbucks' culture of customizing the heck out of everything."
Harper A.,"San Bruno, CA",I looovveee their spicy tonkatsu ramen!! My go to bowl of ramen. Usually love to add on bamboo shoots and an egg. This bowl of ramen is definitely filling and super flavorful. My boyfriend usually gets the chicken ramen and he loves it too. Recommend if you're looking for a solid bowl of ramen in the city.
Justin T.,"CA, CA","I usually don't have much expectation for restaurants inside of malls or shopping centers , BUT THiS ONE held it down !! I ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu medium , which wasn't too spicy I could have gone with hot even tho I'm not a super spice guy . It was great ! Food came out fast ! & I liked that the server dealt with my transaction immediately, rather than leave check and come back in 10mins to grab my card haha  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!"
Maddie And Abel M.,"San Jose, CA","Marufuku never fails to amaze us. We ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu DX with a side of their seasonal chicken bites and edamame. Their chicken bites are hands down their best appetizer and we recommend that everyone order them at least once. The chicken and bao bun are a perfect combo of crunchy and soft textures! The Hakata was just as yummy and you can remove any topping you'd like. ,The staff was friendly as usual and we're very quick when giving us our order. They're on top of cleaning tables in between uses and are thorough! If you're in Japantown and are looking for a ramen place to eat at, definitely stop by Marufuku!"
Juvy H.,"Chicago, IL","Definitely one of the best ramen I've had outside of Japan. The tonkatsu broth was flavored just right. My friend had their veggie broth and though good, it would probably have been better minus the arugula."
Cherie C.,"Antioch, CA","One of my top 3 favorite ramens, the ONLY thing I'm sad about is that this particular ramen I ordered is seasonal :( I am a huge fan of my ramen have spicy ground pork in it and this is the second ramen I have found that had it. The bean sprouts brought a great consistency to it. I absolutely love this ramen and can't wait to eat again!"
Emily F.,"San Francisco, CA","Omg. Amazing experience. I'm obsessed.,I regret eating a muffin before attending Marufuku Ramen because I wish I had room for more. Definitely attending again :) ,Seriously top-tier ramen. I would not expect anything less, though, based on the glowing reviews and eating at another German Fabregas restaurant in Vegas. ,I believe I ordered the traditional Tonkotsu Ramen and my expectations were exceeded. ,Even Marufuku branding details, down to the physical bowl of ramen, had special attention to detail! As you finish your ramen, check the inside of the bowl for an awesome branded experience. ,Thank you for the excellent experience!"
Song H.,"Pleasanton, CA","Saturday morning around 11:30am, used their iPad to add myself to the waitlist. You can do this on Yelp (add to waitlist), too. Estimated wait time was 45-60 mins, but after just 15 mins got a text that our table was ready. Yeah! They give you 5 mins to check in so don't go too far. We were browsing some manga at the the bookstore next door so we were close. Have your vaccine and ID cards ready. The place is small so it gets filled up quickly; however they also turn the tables over quickly. I don't think lingering is encouraged. We barely sat down when we were asked what we wanted to order. We got tokayaki and squid appetizers, which were fine, but i guess it's the ramen you go there for. I got the Vegetarian Ramen and it was good! The broth was flavorful and it comes with an egg (if you want it), cherry tomatoes, masuma green, spinach noodles and tofu! Very filling. Wait staff was polite and friendly. Others in my party got the Hakata and seemed to enjoy it. Only one person said they didn't like the noodles cause it was too thin (more like vermecelli?)"
Tim H.,"Big Bear, CA",I own a Ramen shop in Southern California and I am a huge Ramen connoisseur. I travel all over seeking the best bowl of Ramen I can find and honestly I give this Ramen at 9 1/2 out of 10 the only thing that could've been better was the quality of the noodles not saying they were bad in anyway but the broth and the cashu pork Were unbelievable and the noodles were great as well. I just think if they had housemaid noodles the Ramen would've been a 20 out of 10 absolutely mind blowing to see the quality and the service this business had
Alejandro I.,"Palmdale, CA",Amazing service ! Amazing Food. Best ramen by far. Worth the wait. There are a lot of shops and things to do while waiting. Definitely will be coming back. Chicken Paitan DX is limited to 15 servings per day and got lucky we tried both styles of Ramen.
Jenny H.,"San Francisco, CA","I've been to the Oakland location before coming to this location and it was just as good as the first time!,Pirikara Chicken Bites: these were super yummy! Still crispy chicken but also deliciously saucey and sweet!,Spicy Tantan men: this was my first time getting this (I believe it's a seasonal special?). It's around a medium spicy level if you were to get the regular Tonkotsu ramen. I think there was some ground meat in here but there was so little I couldn't really tell. I wish they added more meat! I missed the huge chunk of char siu that comes with the regular ramen. Overall, very yummy though!"
Ashima H.,"Temecula, CA",Very good ramen. The tonkotsu is the one we had. Always a place for comfort food. One of the few places that have chicken ramen too. There's always a wait. So try to get there in time.
Tiffany N.,"San Jose, CA","I got the tonkatsu and my bf got the seasonal tantan men. The tonkatsu was good but does taste pretty similar to other ramen places I've tried. If you want to be bold and try something new, the tantan men is very rich with a deep taste. It can be a bit salty and heavy for some but something worth trying if you want to be spontaneous"
Guillermo P.,"San Francisco, CA","This is just a Vegetarian Ramen review. They only have one vegetarian ramen. I am sorry to say it was just ok....not worth the wait.  Didn't have much flavor, the raw onions, red peppers, and cherry tomatoes didn't work in the dish. For vegetarian ramen go to Hinodeya, they do an outstanding one. FYI- mild spicy here  basically not spicy.,I would suggest replacing the raw veggies with one roasted tomato and  half a soft boiled  egg"
Christy L.,"Westminster, CA","It was convenient that it was upstairs from Jina's Bakes. While waiting in line there we put our name on the waitlist here and by the time we got our pastries, our table was ready. ,Ordered the Chicken Paitan DX, Tonkatsu ramen and Marufuku bites. Food came out extremely fast. ,Both broths were rich and savory, packed with an umami roasted bone broth flavor. I'm normally a pork person but the chicken Paitan was exceptional. Chicken breast meat poached to perfection, tender and melts in your mouth. The DX version came with a grilled chicken leg. Although I'd skip it next time. It's not needed unless you were super hungry and a major carnivore. ,The bao buns were average, a bit strong on ginger which is not to my taste. Also felt we were cattle herded while eating. Felt rushed eating there during prime lunch time."
Jung L.,"San Leandro, CA","I'm usually not a big fan of ramen, but I love the Hakata Tonkatsu here! I loved the broth as it was flavorful yet not too heavy. One thing worth noting is that the spice levels are not that spicy. I ordered the medium spice level, but it wasn't spicy at all.,Nonetheless, definitely worth a try :)"
Regina X.,"San Francisco, CA","Very underwhelming..... maybe we had too high of expectation from all the raving reviews. ,We got the Hakata Tonkatsu (mild and medium but there's table side chili powder which adds a good spice) - the ramen was just very.... Mediocore.... Overall it's solid but nothing special, like any other ramen you can get at decent Japanese restaurants so definitely not worth the wait or the price (for the ultra think 2 slides of chasu). Nothing really stands out, Udon Mugizo next door's tonkatsu udon is 100x better.... (Y'all know Tatsu on Sawtelle in LA? Tatsu is more memorable...),The staff were are super friendly and attentive, service 5 stars!!!,Ramen 3.5 stars.... With the wait time and price over 3 stars...,Before you come here, make sure to join the waitlist on Yelp since the wait around dinner time is ~an hour"
Ming M.,"Southport, Fairfield, CT",I had the Hakata Tonkotsu DX and it was so delicious! The broth was very savory and flavorful and had lots of delicious toppings. The meat was soft and slightly sweet. It was extremely filling and had the perfect amount of noodles. Staff was very attentive and quick. You can use a waitlist- I was seated pretty fast.
Tabitha C.,"San Francisco, CA","With COVID, the wait has not been bad at all recently! Take away the horrific wait time and Marufuku becomes THE best ramen place in town. In my opinion, this really is the best ramen in the city. You'd have to make the six-hour drive down to LA to find better. My mom even likes it, and she normally hates ramen!,This place has REALLY good ramen. The wait time kills the good vibe though. The food and service are wonderful, the location upstairs in Japantown is just tiny and super crowded. We almost didn't go here because we thought they didn't have vegetarian options, but they do! Yummy ones! You just have to ask your waiter. ,For a little back story - We had heard the wait was awful so we tried to get on the waitlist exactly at 5:00 pm when they opened for dinner. For some reason you can only get on the waitlist in person when they first open. We ended up there at about 5:15 pm to get on the waitlist in person, and there was just an iPad at the front to check in on Yelp. It was so frustrating. You couldn't check in on Yelp from the mobile app, you had to go in to the restaurant to check in on Yelp. By the time we did this, we were 20th on the waitlist. It took us about 2 hours to get a table after checking in at 5:15 pm. I've heard it's much worse if you get there later. ,I probably won't ever go back unless this process is improved. It shouldn't have been that stressful to get a bowl of ramen."
Cori D.,"Monterey, CA","So good! Absolutely worth the wait, every. Single. Time.  This is the only place I've had chicken ramen and it's so flavorful. My husband loves the tonkutsu ramen as well. The staff is so beyond polite and the food comes out quickly too."
Spencer W.,"Brea, CA","The ramen itself was delicious but what I was most blown away was their fun options.,Absolutely LOVED the spinach-based noodles and octopus with wasabi.  If only more places had that.  Highly recommend.,I've been to too many ramen places.  I'll edit this and add pictures later"
Georgina E.,"Vallejo, CA","Tasty, worth the wait. Chicken and pork ramen are bomb, with medium spice. Add an extra egg, trust me. Combine it With the Japanese ipa, best Japanese ipa I've ever tasted: smooth yet flavorful and hoppy. ,Also had edamame for starters, classic. ,The noodle still needed maybe a few more minutes to be thoroughly cooked, hence the 4 stars. But if you can wait a few min and not devour it like I did, may become the perfect consistency. ,Enjoy!"
Erin S.,"Portland, OR",So yummy. Simple and delicious ramen. I get it spicy and it is so good!! The egg is always cooked to perfection and the pork belly is so soft and flavorful. Amazing noodles with perfect chew!! Can't wait to bring friends here when they visit the city.
Kati G.,"Mill Valley, CA","I am not a big ramen fan. But, wow the flavor of the broth was really amazing. I did medium heat but could have gone spicy. The chicken and fresh ingredients inside were just delicious! Then I tried the gyozas, they were OK, flavor was a little bland for me. But the ramen!,Oh and the service and staff were exceptional!"
Kevin L.,"Fullerton, CA","I had visited this shop with my friend and we ended up getting the chicken braised meat with ramen.,The ramen was great but the chicken was huge!!!,would def recommend to anyone in SF.,The parking is validation so that was nice to have and the wait was not long at all."
Claire C.,"San Francisco, CA","Marufuku ramen is a popular SF spot, and it doesn't disappoint! I've been here a few times and always had a great experience in both the quality of the food as well as the service. ,The restaurant is located in a busy mall, and you can sign in for the waitlist on the ipad outside of the restaurant which will also let you know the wait time. Its connected to the yelp app and you can check your place in line. The time passes by quickly as the mall has many shops you can wander through while you wait. Although the restaurant is on the small side, the staff is very attentive and does a good job of keeping customers moving through quickly (but you never feel rushed!). ,The ramen itself is savory and well cooked. I've tried the hakata tonkatsu, which has a rich and satisfying broth, which is usually the most important component of the ramen for me.  I recently tried the chicken paitan DX, which is limited to 15 being sold per day. While I didn't have any expectations, I was blown away how flavorful the chicken was. You get a bowl of ramen with a few chicken slices in it and chicken leg on a sizzling plate. The chicken leg was extremely juicy and had a rich, but not overpowering, flavor. It is a decent amount of food as well, which makes it well worth the price."
Ava B.,"Sacramento, CA",One of the best ramen places I've ever tried! So tasty and the egg is cooked perfectly! The noodles are unique to other ramen and is really good. Meat is always cooked perfect as well. I usually finish the whole bowl. Amazing!
Mina N.,"Milpitas, CA","Heard about this place for too long and finally decided to check it out! I went on a Monday around mid afternoon. I put my name down on the waitlist and was notified via text about 30 minutes later. Not bad at all.,The ambience is very nice. Everyone greets you on the way in. I opted for the Tonkotsu ramen in the spiciest level. The broth was good! It tasted like thit kho (vietnamese braised meat) in soup form. Very rich in flavor but can get salty towards the end. The noodles had a great bite. Perfectly done. I wish they were more generous with the toppings though. The spiciest level was also not that spicy so I added more of the chili powder available on the table. ,Overall, a solid 4.5. I would love to come back!"
Katy Z.,"Millbrae, CA","Went for lunch on Monday with my cousins around 12:40pm. We added ourselves to the waitlist for 3 people and estimated seat time was 1:23pm. Unfortunately, there was no way to add to the waitlist before arriving to the restaurant or else I would have joined the waitlist prior to arrival. However, we were seated before the expected time at 1:08pm. We ordered 3 bowls of the Hakata Tonkotsu with mild spice with 2 bowls having corn on the side for $1 extra each. The meat was tender and the flavor was perfect, not salty. The only thing we all wished was that we got a medium spice for the ramen as the mild did not have any kick to it.,I would recommend going on a weekday during the day for sure! If this place is too far of a drive for you, I recommend checking out their other locations since they have opened quite a few more after how popular this place has been :)"
Rebecca W.,"San Francisco, CA","Love this place! Super delicious. My only complaint is that there is only one vegetarian option. The one they have is awesome, but I would love to mix it up sometimes.,I'm obviously not the first to say it, but this place is fantastic! I loved the veggie ramen, which doesn't always happen--veggie ramen tends to be hit or miss for me. I was particularly pleased with the broth which was creamy and went beyond the typical miso broth you get with most veggie ramen orders.,We also got the Marufuku salad which was great. The greens were new to me. We asked the server and it is called Japanese misuna, if I am spelling it correctly. Was very happy with the dressing options as well. We got both the plum sauce and soy sauce dressings on the side. I was partial to the soy sauce based dressing but both were good.,Timeline is important to consider when coming here. There is always a wait to get seated--sometimes of multiple hours. It's worth showing up in person because they get all of the people physically in line on the list before they open up the online yelp waitlist. Once you are seated, though, food comes FAST. A few minutes at most. It's helpful to keep this in mind when ordering--your appetizers are more side dishes because everything comes at once."
Spencer H.,"Costa Mesa, CA","Outstanding ramen! We came here for an early weekend dinner to avoid the crowd. Yelp Waitlist said a 80 minute wait but we were seated in 20 mins.,Menu is short but you're here for one thing only: tonkatsu ramen! The ramen is excellent; the noodles are sized to perfect; pork is so juicy.,I loved it. One of the best ramens I've had in NorCal / SoCal"
Joseline M.,"San Francisco, CA","Marufuku Ramen has become one of my favorite ramen spots in the city. The service is great, the seating isn't too bad thanks to their waitlist system and the ramen is one of the tastiest I've had. We tried the Ika Karaage which didn't have a heavy coat on it and it was properly cooked, not chewy but not too soft. Also tried the Hakata Tonkotsu and Hakata Tonkotsu DX, both very tasty and creamy, spicy levels are on the lighter side so if you like very spicy go up a level than usual. Overall the size for the quality and price are great. ,Note: the place is small so don't come during their lunch or dinner rush because it'll take longer for you to get a table."
Nichole C.,"Sacramento, CA","This place was a recommendation and did not disappoint! I would recommend coming earlier and putting your name on the waitlist first and then walking around though! We went on a Saturday and it predicted about a 2 hour wait but we ended up waiting about 1hr and 15 mins for 2 people. ,We got the Hakata Tonkotsu DX because why not go all out right? The broth was so full of flavor and you can tell it's definitely been crafted for a while! The noodles were chewy and not undercooked or overcooked... perfectly in my opinion! The mean was soft and tender and I always love a good soft boiled egg! ,The takoyaki we got was also fresh and full of flavor! ,Would recommend this to anyone in the area! It's located in the Japan center so you can either try to find street parking or like us we opted for the parking structure. Would go again when I have the chance!"
